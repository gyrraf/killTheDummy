# killTheDummy
A textbased, turnbased game where you try to kill the enemy before the enemy kills you.

## Folder structure
The folder structure was made by Eclipse. This is just a copy of the folder I use while working in Eclipse.
The folder contains an executable jar-file, the entire javadoc, the ".class" files and the ".java" files.

## start the programme
There are two ways to start this programme:
1. Start "./killTheDummy/killTheDummy/killTheDummy.jar" using "java -jar killTheDummy.jar" in the console
2. Start "./killTheDummy/killTheDummy/bin/killTheDummy/Fight.class" using "java Fight" in the console.

## Things I still have to do:
- Ability Balance
- Search for Bugs (testing)
- Check for grammatical mistakes and spelling errors

## Things I might do in the future
- Use a GUI (probably with "javax.swing" and "java.awt") instead of the console in and outputs.
